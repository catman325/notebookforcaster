## Base

### Description
The base is a rectangle with the  dimensions of 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick. 
It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

I learned:
*Hit spacebar to clear your selections
*Hit N to straighten out your view, "normal" to your sketch
*inear patterns 
I think github is hard to use
I made alot of progress this week in engineering.

## Mount

### Description
Is a 120mm x120mm rectangle, centered on the origin.
Has 4 symmetric holes in the corners, 10mm in diameter, 20mm from each side (and therefore, 80mm from each other)
Has another 25 mm circle in the center of the square.

### Reflection
I leared that if you click the vertical line and the horizontal line and then hit the = sign, then the rectangle will become a square without having to type in the dementions.

## Fork

### Description
The base is 80 mm diameter , 8mm thick. 
Off of the base there are two symmetrical forks that are 40mm wide and 75mm long with rounded edges
The base is on a cylinder that is 20mm diameter and 5mm thickness, and 60mm in length

### Reflection
I learned that filet will round edges.
Productivity: I am doiong alot of work on my engineering this week.

## Tire

### Description
Inner diameter is 80mm. Outer diameter is 100mm
width is 20mm

### Reflection
You can use construction lines and the symmetric button to make the image symmetrical across the construction line.
I think it is neat to use the revolve to make the tire.
Productivity: I am diong alot of work on my engineering this week.

## Wheel

### Description
The diameter is 80mm, and 20mm wide. It as symmetrical spokes.

### Reflection
So far I think this is the hardest part of the design. 
I am making alot of progress in engineering.

## AxleCollarBearings

### Description
Axle diameter is 10 mm outer diameter and 6mm inner diameter 
Barring is 15mm diameter, 5mm thickness

### Reflection
I learned that to extrude in both directions, you have to push the symmetrical button
You can make two parts and then put them together in the same parts studio.
Productivity: I am doing alot of work on my engineering this week



## Sub-Assymbly

### Description
Assymbly of the tire and wheel with the axle and two bearings.

### Reflection
Sub assembly allows you to put it together in the way that it would actually be assembled.
You can use the assembly tab instead of the parts studio tab and drop parts in to put the parts together.
I feel that I am getting better with on shape. THe most confusing things is how to share the work to github.
I feel that I am being productive this week in engineering.             




## Assembly

### Description- 
Assebly of the tire-wheel-axle-bearings to the fork,mount and base to complete the caster.

### Reflection
Its cool to see all of the parts come together to make the caster.

I feel that I am being productive this week in engineering.
